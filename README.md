# Retarded Codes 


These are a bunch of files in *C* and *Java* destinated for really-beginners.
If you're a new person to programming the best approach it could be start with java
and the logic in this filles implemented. If you're an intermediate or just want to get
sharped into Algorithms & DataStructures get directly to C files. 
Anyways *all roads lead to Rome*
Just enjoy the ride and gets your hands dirty.  


## Test
**As you may could know now, all the stuff that you are going to develop needs be tested, because we don't want to know a week, month later when our minds almost forgot what it was, so give you a peacefully life 
and for all the community and do testing ;) .**
